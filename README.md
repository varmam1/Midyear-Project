# Midyear-Project

This project is needed to be done. Only upload scripts. If no anime, not yet done. 

Take our maze game and make it multiplayer and make it actually work. Also add a working “AI”

The RPG aspect must be better
Inventory menu
Health overlay
Better main menu
Better graphics/assets
Actual Pathfinding on the enemies that actually hurt you


Game Design Document 
The target audience of our game are people who enjoy a good meme. It was made so that we as seniors could de-stress even more than the time where we played cards against humanity. We only implement of pc’s because pc’s are the greatest platform. Also Manu needs some therapy. 
To complete a level the players must find and purify all enemies. The number of enemies is proportional to the number of players. Defeating enemies makes the player stronger, while being defeated causes you lose parameters. 
Our player model is a clorox bottle. The enemies are currently boxes, but may be upgraded to Unity-chan. Animations are good, already mainly done, walking, shooting, Etc. We also shoot tomatoes and have items spawn randomly that give power ups. The walls and floors will hopefully be changed, probably medieval or underworld-ish to match the state of emotion that the player is in. 
There’ll probably start with some japanese music, since that is all we listen to. There will probably be only one scene with the maze, but if we are paid enough we will implement a tutorial. There will hopefully be a UI in game that will let you see your health, parameters, and inventory.
Music will trigger on the start of the game, and loop until the termination of the program. There will also be sound effects for shooting tomatoes, getting items, and getting hit. 
WASD are to move the character, as well as the mouse to look around. The space bar is to shoot. The number keys are used to use items, provided that the item is being carried. And shift is to jump. Camera will be changed with the C key
Algorithms that will or have been used are the maze generation algorithm (recursive division) and A* pathfinding. We will make it so that it scores the board for both the enemy and the player and then adds the 2 together and then just goes in the direction of least score. The maze generation algorithm is just the recursive division which will section off the maze and then do the same in the sub mazes. 
Marketing:
	We will release the game on steam, and pay youtubers to play the game. They will love it and spread to their audience, and we will make the big bucks. Based on the demand curve that we estimated, we will supply the game at a reasonable price of $49.99 plus $77.99 shipping and handling for a certificate that you own a copy of the game. 
Multiplayer:
	For the server side, we want a minimum of 1 and up to 10 players in any given room. No entrance or exit rules. Provided enough time and budget, we will attempt to implement a lobby in which you can create rooms and set your own rules (player size, time, items allowed, PvP or PvE or both). On the client side the players are only supposed to control there character.
